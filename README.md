# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##### Overview of Analysis

The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. This will help the company plan for upcoming retirees and to train their replacement. This will help the company to file possible job gaps or to keep gaps from happening.

##### Results

* The retiring titles table shows the %50 of upcoming retirements will hold a job title as an engineer. (45,397/90,398 = 50%)

* The retirement table shows the length the employee has been with the company as well how long the person has worked in a certain position.

* The unique titles table shows the retirees current position they ae in. 

* If you take a look at the mentorship elibility table you will see that majority already hold a title with senior in the beginning.

##### Summary

Being as though majority of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible there will likely be positions to fill over the next 5-10 years. There may not be enough people in the workforce to fill the job vacancies that will arise that will have the level of experience needed take care of the tasks or meet the companies need. In order to get ahead of the shortage the company should take action now to try to replace the workfore before they retire.
